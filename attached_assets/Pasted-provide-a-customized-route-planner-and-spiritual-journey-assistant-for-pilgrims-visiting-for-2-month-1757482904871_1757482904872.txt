provide a customized route planner and spiritual journey assistant for pilgrims visiting for 2 months. The app should include the following features:

Dynamic Route Planning:

If a pilgrim is arriving by railway station, the map should guide them step by step to reach their designated rituals and routes.

If arriving by bus stand, show the correct route towards the ghats and important rituals.

If arriving by private vehicle, display dedicated parking zones and guide them from the parking lot to the ghat.

Spiritual Ritual Journey Flow:

The app should show the exact sequence of rituals a pilgrim has to perform at Mahakumbh (darshan spots, holy dips, temples, spiritual camps).

Highlight priority spots such as temples, ghats, akharas, and ritual areas.

Customized Bathing Zones at Shipra Ghat:

Separate bathing areas for men, women, and families with clear navigation paths.

Crowd management integration to show real-time congestion (optional advanced feature).

Map Features:

Use an interactive map (OpenStreetMap / Google Maps API / Mapbox) with markers for ghats, rituals, temples, medical camps, food stalls, and parking.

The map should provide walking + vehicle navigation depending on the entry point.

User Experience:

Pilgrims should be able to select how they are coming (railway, bus, car).

Based on the selection, the app should auto-generate the customized journey + route map for their visit.

Provide multi-language support (Hindi, English).

Scalability & Design:

Mobile-first, simple UI with clear navigation arrows and icons for temples, ghats, rituals, and facilities.

Include safety and emergency information (police booths, lost & found, hospitals).

The output should be a prototype plan + wireframe or working code snippet for a MERN stack or React + Mapbox/OpenStreetMap based application, showcasing the above functionality. Make it visually engaging and user-friendly for lakhs of visitors.

ðŸ‘‰ This prompt will help AI tools generate mockups, code, or workflow designs for your customized Mahakumbh map app.

Do you want me to also write the technical breakdown (like which APIs, libraries, and database structure to use) so you can directly start building it?
